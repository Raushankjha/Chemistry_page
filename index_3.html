        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each slemast is represented by its chemod syobol, wach as Fe Sor iron. H Sur hydrogen, and O for oxygen Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

        <p>Chemical reactions are representd using <em>chemical equations.</em> Here's an example of <em>chemical reaction: </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            2H<sub>2</sub> + o<sub>2</sub> --> 2H<sub>2</sub>o
        </p>
        <p>
            This equation represents the reaction between hydropes gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
        </p>
        
        <h4>Important Concept</h4>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Stoichiometry</i></strong> in the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sub>Subscripts</sub>indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atom in an ion.
        </p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
